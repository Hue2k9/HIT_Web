          In the digital age today, electronic devices are of great importance
          to humans. Some popular electrolic devices such as: TV, smart phone,
          laptop, electronic watch, printer, projector... Among them, my
          favortite IT is the laptop because it has accpompanied and helped me
          during the covid-19 epidemic a lot. My laptop is Dell and it’s very
          nice . It’s black and rectangular, its length is about 60 centimeters,
          its weight is about 1.6 kilograms so I can easily carry it. My laptop
          is made of stainless steel. We can use it for doing homework, playing
          game, programing and listening to music….I often use it to write code.
          I like it so much because it’s so convenient and useful.

        <h3>Google</h3>
        <p>
          Google is an IT invention that I like the most. It was invented by
          Larry Page and Sergey Brin – two students at Standford University,
          USA. It was invented in 1996. It plays a very important role in my
          life. It is the most popular Internet search engine in the world. It
          is used for finding out the information people need faster and easier.
          Thousands of people worldwide use it every day because it is fast,
          easy and accurate. I like Google a lot. It helped me find a lot of
          useful information and answer things that I didn’t know.

        <h1>3.Talk about a famous IT person you admire.</h1>
        <h3>Bill Gates</h3>
        <p>
          Bill Gates is my big idol. He is 64 years old and he is American. Now
          he is one of the billionaries in the world and a predent of Microsoft
          Cooperation. His job duties are manage and provide leadership to the
          company’s board of directors. The first time I have heard of him was
          in the IT class as my teacher called him as a model of the successful
          businessman. I admire his quote enormously: “If you are born poor, it
          is not your mistake. But you die poor, it is your mistake.” I like him
          because he inspires me about technology. I want to become a person
          like him in the future.
