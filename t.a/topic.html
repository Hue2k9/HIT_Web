          I received a very precious gift from my farther on my 17th birthday.
          It was a Dell laptop. It is so difficult to describe the laptop in
          words, but I would just tell you something about. It was an i3 and it
          has a black color, it’s screen 14 inches and its material is plastic.
          Laptop works successfully using its hardware and fully installed
          application software. Other accessories of the computer are keyboard,
          mouse, printer, CPU and UPS. The data which I put into the computer
          using device is called input data and device as input device and data
          which I take outside using printer or the other device is called as
          output data and device as output device. The input data gets changed
          into the information which can be stored and changed anytime. It is
          very safe tool for data storage which is being used in various fields.
          I can shop, pay our electricity bill, water bill, video chat,
          messaging, e-mail messages anywhere in the world and lots of online
          activities using the internet.

        <h1>Talk about the problem(s) of an IT device that you have just bought</h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          I bought a laptop last week on a big IT website. However, against all my expectations, I was fairly dissatisfied with quality of the product and its delayed arrival.
I ordered online on January 15th. But it's been two weeks, I just received this product while you promised to send it to me in about 6 days. Second, the laptop I received froze on first use and I had to restart it about 4 times after 3 days of use.
Then i contacted the technician to tell them about the problems I had when using it. It took 3 days for my laptop to be delivered to them. After fixing it and sending the laptop back to me, it's already been a week. After that, I was really careful to buy IT equipment online.
