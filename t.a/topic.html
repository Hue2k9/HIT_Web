        <h3>Computer components</h3>
        <p>
          My HP flyer laptop is a notebook computer. It was a present from my
          parents to congratulate me on passing college. Packed with a large 15
          inches display, a decent Intel Pentium N3540 2.16GHz CPU processor and
          a 1TB hard drive. This HP laptop model would work well for portability
          with its 6 pounds, lightweight design and sleek black/silver look. It
          is useful for my school tasks. The basic structure of my laptop system
          is made up of 3 main hardware sections: First, the CPU is a processor
          chip which executes program instructions and coordinates the
          activities of all the inner components. Second, the main holds the
          instructions and data which are being processed by the CPU. Last,
          peripherals are the physical units attached to the computer. They
          include storage devices and input/output devices. My HP flyer laptop
          allows I to multitask with 4GB RAM and a processor intel Pentium N3540
          2.16 GHz.

        <p>
          I bought a laptop last week on a FPT shop. However, against all my
          expectations, I was very unsatisfied with the quality of the product
          and it was slow to arrive. I ordered online on September 15th. But
          it's been two weeks, I just received this product while the seller
          promised to send it to me in about 6 days. Unfortunately, this item
          did not function at all and I noticed this problem as soon as I
          unpacked it from box. The laptop I received froze on first use and I
          had to restart it about 4 times after 3 days of use. I was very
          confused. Then I contacted the technician to tell them about the
          problems I had when using it. It took 3 days for my laptop to be
          delivered to them. After fixing it and sending the laptop back to me,
          it's already been a week. After that, I was really careful to buy IT
          equipment online.

          6. Talk about a company in the field of Information Technology that
          you know.
        </h1>
        <h3>Apple Inc.</h3>
        <p>
          Well, the first technology company that comes to mind is called
          “Apple”. Apple is an American multinational technology corporation.
          Its headquarter is located in California and it specializes in the
          design, development and sale of consumer electronics, computer
          software and online services. Apple was founded in April 1976 by Steve
          Jobs. Apple’s headquarters is located in USA and has 500 locations.
          Currently, Apple has 14,800 employees in many countries. It’s is a big
          company and will have good treatment for employees and I really like
          their tech products. After graduating from university with my current
          major, I dream of working for Apple in the future because the salary
          is high. I believe that joining a big company will help me learn many
          things and the benefits will be good ability. So I will try to study
          well.
