          to humans. Some popular electronic devices such as: TV, smart phone,
          laptop, electronic watch, printer, projector... Among them, my
          favorite IT device is the laptop because it has accompanied and helped
          me during the covid-19 pandemic a lot. I have a new laptop. It is very
          expensive. The price is 1000 dollars. My laptop brand is Dell and it’s
          very nice. It’s black and rectangular, its length is about 60
          centimeters, its weight is about 1.6 kilograms so I can easily carry
          it. My laptop is made of stainless steel. It has many functions such
          as shopping, paying electricity and water bills, video calling,
          sending emails without leaving the house. Computer is also a means to
          help students learn online. I often use it for doing homework, playing
          game, programing and listening to music… I like it so much because
          it’s so convenient and useful.

          is used for finding out the information people need faster and easier.
          Google allows users to search for the information they desire through
          the use of keywords and operators. Thousands of people worldwide use
          it every day because it is fast, easy and accurate. In addition to the
          tiring learning times, we can use the Google for entertainment,
          watching movies, listening to music,… I like Google a lot. It helped
          me find a lot of useful information and answer things that I didn’t
          know. I feel so lucky and happy to have been born in a time when

        <h1>4. Describe the components of your computer/ laptop.</h1>
        <h3>Computer components</h3>
        <p>
          I have a desktop computer which is manufactured by HP. It is black and
          made of metal with the monitor screen size of 24 inches. It has a lot
          of components such as CPU, main memory, motherboard, keyboard, mouse,
          monitor, etc and each component performs its own function. The
          motherboard is the back-bone of the computer when connecting all the
          components inside the system.The CPU which is called the brain of the
          computer is used to execute program instructions and coordinate the
          activities of all the other units. The main memory holds the
          instructions and data which are being processed by the CPU. The
          keyboard is an input device for entering data into the computer while
          the monitor is an output device used to display texts or images on the
          screen. The computer can hold 16GB of Ram and 2TB of hard drive space.
          Additionally, it comes with an Intel core i5 processor running at
          3.2GHz, which makes the computer run very fast and smoothly.

          5. Talk about the problem(s) of an IT device that you have just bought
        </h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          I bought a laptop last week on a FPT shop. However, against all my
          expectations, I was very unsatisfied with the quality of the product
          and it was slow to arrive. I ordered online on September 15th. But
          it's been two weeks, I just received this product while the seller
          promised to send it to me in about 6 days. Unfortunately, this item
          did not function at all and I noticed this problem as soon as I
          unpacked it from box. The laptop I received froze on first use and I
          had to restart it about 4 times after 3 days of use. I was very
          confused. Then I contacted the technician to tell them about the
          problems I had when using it. It took 3 days for my laptop to be
          delivered to them. After fixing it and sending the laptop back to me,
          it's already been a week. After that, I was really careful to buy IT
          equipment online.

        <h3>Apple Inc.</h3>
        <p>
          Well, the first technology company that comes to mind is called
          “Apple”. Apple is an American multinational technology corporation.
          Its headquarter is located in California and it specializes in the
          design, development and sale of consumer electronics, computer
          software and online services. Apple was founded in April 1976 by Steve
          Jobs. Apple’s headquarters is located in USA and has 500 locations.
          Currently, Apple has 14,800 employees in many countries. It’s is a big
          company and will have good treatment for employees and I really like
          their tech products. After graduating from university with my current
          major, I dream of working for Apple in the future because the salary
          is high. I believe that joining a big company will help me learn many
          things and the benefits will be good ability. So I will try to study
          well.

        <h1>7. Talk about IT security and safety rules at workplace</h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          Keeping your computer safe and secure at work is not only good for
          you, it's good for the business and with myself. I often do with the
          computer at the office, I usually put the documents in a folder, then
          send it to the cloud, then delete it on the computer and then log out
          of the account. I don't save my account on the company computer. The
          gmail account I always connect it to my phone for authentication. I
          use a VPN to avoid losing my IP to another cookie and that will cause
          my account to be hacked. I'm using Microsoft's anti-virus software on
          Windows. These are some of the ways I often use to secure the
          information I want to share with everyone, I hope it will be useful.
          Because nowadays there are many scams to steal people's information,
          Therefore, we should have our own information security measures.

        <h1>8. Write about IT security and safety rules at workplace</h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          My office belongs to a large company, so computer security is very
          important. And here are some rules of information technology safety
          and security. First, before I leave the office, I will turn off the
          computer, disconnect the power, and close the door. I will create a
          password for my computer that only I know. I usually set a password as
          a string of letters and numbers, it's hard to remember, I change it
          often. Second, when I have an attachment in an email, I will only
          allow the person to whom I want to send the file to open, I will not
          open the file from suspicious accounts, even if someone else receives
          the email for security measures I use a firewall. I think this is the
          best way to secure my computer. Firewalls are hard to get through and
          my computer is always safe.

        <h1>9. Write simple safety instructions of an IT product</h1>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          I have a laptop. It is very important in my work and life. That's why,
          from the first day I bought it, I was concerned about protecting it. I
          have installed anti-virus software for my laptop, do not open spam
          emails, don't open email attachments from strangers, change the
          password used to open the laptop and the password for personal
          information regularly. I regularly bring it to the center to have
          staff upgrade its security software. The above measures have helped my
          laptop a lot, it has not suffered from security problems such as virus
          infection, spyware, malware, hacker attack, phishing. After two years
          of use, my laptop is still working very well, it is still very useful
          for my work and entertainment.
